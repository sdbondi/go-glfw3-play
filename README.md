Simple examples using [github.com/go-gl/gl](https://github.com/go-gl/gl) and  [github.com/go-gl/glfw3](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw3)

**Just playing around with go bindings for opengl and mouse input**
**If you are lookinh for something amazing: move along, nothing to see here :D**

To build:

- Install/build `opengl` and `glfw3`
